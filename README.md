# Assistive Systems Questionnaire
The files in this repository are meant to measure the fulfillment of principles for the ergonomic design of assistive systems defined in the DIN 92419: Acceptance, Optimization of internal load, Safety, Security and Privacy, Adaptability, Controllability, and Perceptibility and Identifiability. One file is a questionnaire that users of assistive systems can fill and the second file is a checklist for practical steps in the development process of assistive systems.

They are available in Enlgish and any contribution for further development is welcomed.
