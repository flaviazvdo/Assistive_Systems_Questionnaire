# Assistive Systems Questionnaire
The files in this repository are meant to measure the fulfillment of principles for the ergonomic design of assistive systems defined in the DIN 92419: Acceptance, Optimization of internal load, Safety, Security and Privacy, Adaptability, Controllability, and Perceptibility and Identifiability. 

They are available in Enlgish and can support future works in research and development of assistive systems.
